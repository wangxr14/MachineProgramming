## 1 - Install 

> This realization of this part has already been done by us.

1. Download project from Gitlab to VMs

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.engr.illinois.edu/xinranw5/MachineProgramming.git
```

- The latest version of codes is on master branch


2. Locate projects on /home of each VM, and move files

```bash
// go to /home/MachineProgramming/
cd /home/MachineProgramming/

// change the first line of mp.config to the number of each vm
// make sure that this file is in /home/MachineProgramming/src
sudo vi mp.config  
```


## 2 - Compile & Run

We use gradle in this MP to help us build and run the programs.

1.  Run MP4 (& MP2 & MP3)
We use the same task name to run the main program of MP3

```bash
cd /home/MachineProgramming/
// Run Detector 
// Gradle will compile and run this task automatically
gradle Detector
```

2.  Run Logger (MP1)
For MP1, we can also use the same way to run Server and Client

```bash
cd /home/MachineProgramming/
// Run Client 
gradle Client
// Run Server
gradle Server
// make sure that /home/mp1/ contains vm_x.log file
```


## 3 - User Input

The Detector will continuously receive user input, until the input is "quit" or the process is killed.
The program will deal with those input:
1. quit
Detector will quit.

7. put localFile sdfsFile

9. delete sdfsFile
